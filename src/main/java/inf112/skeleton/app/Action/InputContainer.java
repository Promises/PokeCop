/**
 * Each key on the keyboard (with some exceptions) are represented in Keys.class as an int between 0 and 255.
 * To update key status, you change the specific index. To check if a key is pressed,
 * you look up the boolean value at the key's index.
 * This approach makes it much easier to implement additional keys,
 * as you only need to add an additional line to the handleKeys method.
